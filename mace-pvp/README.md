# ⚔️ Spear-Mace PVP

A fast-paced 2D aerial platformer fighting game inspired by **Minecraft's Mace and Spear mechanics**, remastered from an original Khan Academy ProcessingJS project into a modern, zero-dependency HTML5 application with procedural Web Audio sound synthesis, particle effects, multiple difficulty archetypes, and local 2-Player duel mode.

## ⚔️ Combat Mechanics

### 1. The Mace Slam (Heavy Impact)
- **Height-Scaled Damage**: Dropping on top of an opponent deals damage based on how far above them you were:
  $$\text{Damage} = \text{clamp}(20 + \Delta \text{Height} \times 1.0, 20, 150)$$
  *Dropping from the skybox off the top edge can land massive 100+ critical hits!*
- **Ground Shockwave**: If you land a slam on the ground near an opponent ($\le 30\text{px}$ radius), it unleashes a ground shockwave for 20 area-of-effect damage.
- **Attacker Bounce**: Successfully connecting with a slam launches you back into the air with $-12$ velocity, resetting your dash so you can immediately chain aerial strikes!

### 2. The Spear Dash (Wind Charge)
- Dashing horizontally into an opponent deals **20 dash damage** and knocks them back.
- Works both on the ground and mid-air.
- You can even dash **mid-slam** to adjust your horizontal alignment!

### 3. Off-Screen Orbit Indicators
- Jumps and bounces can launch you high above the arena ceiling. An off-screen indicator triangle dynamically tracks your altitude in pixels.

## ⚡ Ultra-Responsive & Zero-Lag Architecture

The game has been engineered specifically for competitive-grade low latency and consistent frame pacing:
1. **Fixed 60Hz Physics Timestep with Accumulator**:
   - Uses a delta-time accumulator loop (`FIXED_DT = 1000 / 60`).
   - Prevents physics from running at double speed on 120Hz/144Hz ProMotion screens while ensuring identical jump arcs, dash distances, and hitstun regardless of monitor refresh rate.
   - Includes a 100ms spiral-of-death clamp to eliminate lag spikes on background tab resume.
2. **Jump & Dash Input Buffering**:
   - Stores jump inputs up to 6 frames (~100ms) before landing, automatically executing instant leaps the exact frame a fighter touches down.
   - Buffers dashes and weapon attacks during cooldown or stun recovery, eliminating dropped inputs.
   - Snappy horizontal braking (`0.65` ground deceleration) and instant directional turnaround eliminate floaty slide latency.
3. **Zero-Allocation Hot Update Loop (GC Elimination)**:
   - Fighter rosters (`allFighters`) and team targets are cached and iterated using in-place indexed `for` loops without allocating temporary arrays (`.filter()`, spread `[...]`) every tick.
   - Direct `_botAI` property references eliminate linear lookups and closure allocations on combat hits.
   - Audio noise buffers (1.0s) are precomputed once, eliminating per-dash/per-slam Float32 buffer allocations.
4. **Canvas & GPU Hardware Acceleration**:
   - `#game-canvas` utilizes `transform: translateZ(0)` and `will-change: transform` to force dedicated GPU composite layering.
   - `touch-action: none` on canvas and `touch-action: manipulation` across all buttons eliminates mobile 300ms click delay.
   - Batched particle drawing eliminates redundant canvas state stack saves and restores.

## 🔊 Sound Design
All sound effects in Spear-Mace PVP are **100% procedurally synthesized** via the standard browser Web Audio API:
- **Mace Slam**: Resonant anvil crunch + sub-bass frequency sweep.
- **Spear Dash**: White noise wind-burst envelope.
- **Ground Shockwave**: Low-frequency rumble.
- **Double Jump**: High-frequency sparkle.
- **Invisibility**: Mysterious phased acoustic warning.
- *Zero external sound files or network requests required.*
